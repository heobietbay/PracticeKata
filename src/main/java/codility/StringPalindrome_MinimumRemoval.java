/**
 * You are given a string S containing lowercase English letters.
 * Your task is to calculate the minimum number of letters that need to be removed
   in order to make it possible to build a palindrome from the remaining letters.
 *  When building the palindrome, you can rearrange the remaining letters in any way.
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same both forwards and backwards. Some examples of palindromes are: "kayak", "radar", "mom".
 * Write a function:
 * def solution(S)
 * which, given a string of length N, returns the minimum number of letters that need to be removed.
 * Examples:
 * 1. Given S = "ervervige", your function should return 2. After removing the letter "g" and one "e", we may create a word "reviver", which is a palindrome.
 * 2. Given S = "aaabab, your function should return 0. We may create a word "aabbaa", which is a palindrome and uses all the letters.
 * 3. Given S = "x", your function should return 0. String "x" is a palindrome itself, so we do not have to delete any letter.
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * N is an integer within the range [1..200,000):
 * S contains only lowercase English letters.
