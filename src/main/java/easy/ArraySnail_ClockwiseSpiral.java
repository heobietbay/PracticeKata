/**
 * This problem was asked by Amazon.
 <pre>
 * Given a N by M matrix of numbers, print out the matrix in a clockwise spiral.
 *
 * For example, given the following matrix:
 *
 * [[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
 *  [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
 *  [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 *  [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
 * You should print out the following:
 *
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 4
 * 5
 * 10
 * 15
 * 20
 * 19
 * 18
 * 17
 * 16
 * 11
 * 6
 * 7
 * 8
 * 9
 * 14
 * 13
 * 12

     Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.
     array = [[1,2,3],
             [4,5,6],
             [7,8,9]]
     snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
     For better understanding, please follow the numbers of the next array consecutively:
     array = [[1,2,3],
             [8,9,4],
             [7,6,5]]
     snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
     NOTE: The idea is not sort the elements from the lowest value to the highest;
     the idea is to traverse the 2-d array in a clockwise snailshell pattern.
     NOTE 2: The 0x0 (empty matrix) is represented as [[]]
