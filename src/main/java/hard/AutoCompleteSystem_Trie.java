/**
 * This problem was asked by Twitter.
 *<p>
 * Implement an autocomplete system.
   <pre>That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.</pre>
 *
  For example, given the query string <font color='blue'>de</font>
  and the set of strings <font color='green'>[dog, deer, deal]</font>  return <b>[deer, deal]</b>.
 *</p>
 * Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.
