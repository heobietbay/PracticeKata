/**
 * This problem was asked by Amazon.
 <pre>
 * An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.
 *
 * Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in <b>faster than linear time</b>.
 * If the element doesn't exist in the array, return null.
 *
 * For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).
 *
 * You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.
