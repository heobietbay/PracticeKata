/**
 * This problem was asked by Google.
 <p>
 *  Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.
 *  <pre>
 *  For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.
    In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.
 </pre>
 *
 *  Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.
