 * This problem was asked by Google.

 * Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.
 * It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:
   <pre>
   set(key, value): sets key to value.
      If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.

   get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
  </pre>
  * Each operation should run in O(1) time.
