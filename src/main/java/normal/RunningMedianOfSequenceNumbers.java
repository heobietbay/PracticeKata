 * This problem was asked by Microsoft.
 * <p>
   Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers.
   That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
   Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.
   <pre>
     For example, given the sequence <b>[2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5]</b>, your algorithm should print out:
     2
     1.5
     2
     3.5
     2
     2
     2
   </pre>
